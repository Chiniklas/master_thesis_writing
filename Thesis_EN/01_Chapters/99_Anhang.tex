\chapter{An appendix}

You can structure appendices, just like your thesis, with the \verb*|\chapter|, \verb*|\section|, and \verb*|\subsection| commands. Referencing also works as usual.

If your thesis does not contain an appendix, comment out the creation of the appendix at the appropriate place in the \texttt{Thesis.tex} file.
