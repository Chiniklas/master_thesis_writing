% Use the \includeonly command if you want to work only on certain chapters. Although you could get the same effect by commenting out the appropriate chapters. However, the \includeonly command has the advantage that it can take bookmarks from the uncompiled chapters. This preserves references and directory entries from these chapters, for example.
